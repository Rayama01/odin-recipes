<h2>Beef stew is both filling and delicious</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite dinners; it fills you up and is super delicious.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>


<ul>
    <li>3 pounds well-marbled beef chuck stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>5 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
    <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups) </li>
    <li>2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 cup) </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the beef: </strong> In a large bowl, season the beef pieces with 1 tablespoon of the salt. Heat the olive oil in a large (6 to 8 quart), thick-bottomed pot over high heat.

        Add the beef all at once and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink and some liquid has accumulated at the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.</li>

    <li><strong>Add the vegetables: </strong> Add the celery, onion, carrots, and parsnips. Reduce heat to medium-high. Season with remaining teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and vegetables are slightly softened, about 10 minutes more. 

        Add the thyme and flour, stir, and cook until raw flour is no longer visible, about 30 seconds.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Add the broth and simmer: </strong>Add the beef broth, water, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered and stirring every 20 minutes or so, until stew has darkened and thickened slightly, about 1 hour.</li>

    <li><strong>Add the potatoes and finish: </strong>Add potatoes to the stew, stir well, and continue to simmer until the potatoes and beef are tender, about 30 minutes. Season to taste, transfer to serving bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.

        Refrigerate leftovers, tightly covered, for up to 5 days.</li>
