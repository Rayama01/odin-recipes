<p>This recipe is a great way to use overripe bananas to make a super simple and delicious breakfast</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>


<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups mashed ripe bananas (3 small or 2 large bananas)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
            
    <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients: </strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>

    <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients: </strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed bananas and eggs. Add the buttermilk, whole milk, oil, and vanilla extract and mix until all ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Make the batter: </strong> Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until all ingredients are just combined in a smooth batter. It is okay if your batter has some small lumps; dont overmix.</li>

    <li><strong>Cook the pancakes: </strong> Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle to medium-low heat. Spray with cooking spray. Scoop 1/3 cup of batter onto the skillet. If you have room, repeat to form 2 to 4 pancakes, without their edges touching, depending on the size of your pan or griddle. Cook until you see bubbles come to the surface of the pancake and the edges appear to be cooked, approximately 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a serving plate.</li>

    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> (greasing the pan each time) until you have used up all of the batter.</li>
