# odin-recipes
This project was made for The Odin Project using HTML and CSS. I kept the website as it was, including class names, Etc., even after I added the final website and made sure everything worked. That was on purpose so I could see my progression in web development.
What I learned

* I learned the basics of git and Github.
* I learned the basics of HTMl and CSS and how to code with them.
* I learned how to structure a website.
* and learned the basics of Linux's cli and file management.
